# M5-MQTT-JSON

Simple program for M5Stack to show MQTT data from multiple MQTT sources and set alarms.

The interface is composed by multiple screens with data from different locations.

Also, we can modify brightness.

## Notes

For special characters, i.e. 'ÂºC', I take them from [here](https://unicode-table.com/en/search/?q=degree)
